# Chess Game in Python

This project is a simple console-based chess game implemented in Python, allowing two players to move pieces on a standard 8x8 chessboard. It supports all the basic chess moves and enforces basic movement rules for each piece type, including pawns, rooks, knights, bishops, queens, and kings. The game also includes move history tracking and the option to generate a visual game tree for analyzing past moves.

## Authors

* David Guerra Morales
* Eder Ceballos Quiroz
* Thomas Bedoya Rendon

## Features

* Basic chess piece movement validation (e.g., pawn two-step move, castling not included).
* Console-based interactive gameplay.
* Move history tracking.
* Visual game tree generation using Graphviz.
* Simple text-based board display.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* `anytree` library (for game tree generation)
* Graphviz (for generating game tree images)

To install the required packages, run:

```bash
pip install anytree
```

Graphviz is required to visualize the game tree. If you don't have it installed, you can install it using:

* **Ubuntu/Debian:** `sudo apt install graphviz`
* **Mac (Homebrew):** `brew install graphviz`
* **Windows:** Download the installer from the [official website](https://graphviz.org/download/).

## How to Run the Game

1. Clone this repository or download the `chess.py` file.
2. Run the game with the following command:

```bash
python chess.py
```

3. Follow the on-screen prompts to make moves. Use standard algebraic notation (e.g., `e2 e4`) to specify moves.
4. To exit the game, type `exit`.

## Example Gameplay

```plaintext
Welcome to Python Chess Game!
Enter moves in format: e2 e4
  a b c d e f g h
8 r n b q k b n r 8
7 p p p p p p p p 7
6 . . . . . . . . 6
5 . . . . . . . . 5
4 . . . . . . . . 4
3 . . . . . . . . 3
2 P P P P P P P P 2
1 R N B Q K B N R 1
  a b c d e f g h
White's turn.
Your move (start end) or 'exit': e2 e4
Move successful.
```

## Generating the Game Tree

After the game ends, a game tree visualization can be generated by running:

```bash
python chess.py
```

This will create a `game_tree.png` file representing the sequence of moves.

## Future Improvements

* Implement castling and en passant.
* Add check, checkmate, and stalemate detection.
* Implement a basic AI for single-player mode.
